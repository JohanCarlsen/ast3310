This program consists of three Python files which are used together. 
The programs all save figures to a figures/-folder with subfolders for 
testing and sanity checks. It is also assumed that the user has the 
program energy_production.py in a folder one layer above called stellar-engined.

Run the program energy_transport.py to perform the sanity checks.
The programs use a modifies version of the cross_section.py program, so this also 
has to be included. The program star_model.py uses energy_transport.py, 
energy_production.py and cross_section.py.

My apologies for the lack of comments in the code.
