The program convection.py will first perform the sanity check 
and then the actual simulation with the 2D Gaussian perturbation
added to the initial temperature. To run the code from the terminal:

> python convection.py

Animations will be saved in the figures/animations/ folder, whilst 
all figures will be saved in the working directory, courtesy of FVis.py.
